			<p class="fonts">Hello, my name is Tanner McClain and I’m an aspiring full-stack developer. Though I do not have an extensive coding background, I have yet to back down from a challenge and have worked against far tougher odds weighed against me. In my educational career, I maintained a 3.4+ GPA at Sacramento State earning a BA in Government with minors in Engineering and Mathematics while working a physically demanding job in the construction field. I’ve worked for non-profits, served my community and participated in political activism. After working for a political entity for a year, I returned to the construction field to take a break from the 24-hr cycle of crazy…and this was even before Donald Trump (Ha!). I needed to maintain a job for all practical reasons, but have definitely wanted to find another field to venture into that promotes and pushes the boundaries of my abilities more than my current position.</p>

			Now on the fun side of things, I try to enjoy my limited time when I’m not working or in school. I’m a Netflix and streaming junkie, literally watched the office seasons 1-9 10 times. When I’m not trying to zone out in my bean bag (yes I own a bean bag, its huge) I’m listening to music, researching political developments, watching video commentary, the news and doing some creative writing. I still manage to be able to find time to work out frequently and go out to the bars with friends every once in a while. I’ve got a killer sense of humor, like long walks on the beach and love Chilis (the restaurant). If you want to know more, just ask!</p>
